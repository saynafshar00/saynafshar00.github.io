                        <p>DimpleDesk is a Data-Driven Responsive Web Application, that enables hosts to list workspaces, and tenants to find and rent workspaces efficiently. The project development took place within 12 weeks, from concept ideation and research to design, development and execution.</p>
                        <p>The design and Development team is consisted of 7 members, 3 Designers (One Designer as Project Manager) and 4 Developers. You can find the team member's information on the Member's information Tab above.</p>

                        <h3>Problem</h3>
                        <p>We will be solving two main problems: First, people want to rent out extra workspace in their homes during business hours for additional income. This enables privacy during non-working hours. Secondly, people want a dedicated workspace away from home when their workspace at home does not meet their needs.</p>

                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        <p>We will be solving these two problems by creating a web platform that enables hosts to list workspaces and tenants to find and rent workspaces that suit their needs easily. We will be focusing on designing and developing the tenant side of the platform for MVP.</p>

                            <p>Our extensive collection of listings enables users to search and view workspaces from anywhere.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>This feature provides people without ideal workspaces a way to find personal workspaces for rent and homeowners to showcase their extra home workspaces. For tenants, this solves their problem of not having ideal workspaces at home by providing affordable alternatives. The listings will be created by homeowners who have underutilized workspaces at home. Listing creation is scoped out of the MVP version of the platform.

                            <p>As a call-to-action, users may contact hosts directly from a given listing’s details page.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>This feature provides a method for potential tenants to contact the host of a workspace listing. When a potential tenant contacts the host, the system will send out an email to the host (tenant’s profile information, interested listing, and interested dates) and another email to the potential tenant (contacted host confirmation, interested listing, and interested dates). Potential tenants can find the contacted list on “contacted”.

                            <p>We make it easy for users to find workspaces and filter based on desirable amenities.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>This feature allows potential tenants to quickly browse through and find listings that meet their needs. Potential tenants will be able to search through listings by filtering down the options by workspace type (private or shared), rental terms (daily / weekly / monthly), amenities, and professional interests. This solves the potential tenants’ problem of not being able to find workspace listings that meet their needs quickly.

                    <h2 class="expand m-bott-non">User Experience</h2>
                    <p>The concept of the project, due to the limited development duration and within 12 weeks, prompted our design team to only focus on the MVP features, which are to search for listings, filtering options and contacting the host for the client-side. User search listings within the DimpleDesk platform by inputting location keywords, such as "Vancouver, BC" and get access to a variety of listings based on the designated location and selected filters.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Host-side, where the user can create property listings to get rented through the platform is a milestone to reach for the future roadmap. Our future roadmap includes booking and transaction features within platform that were out of the scope of the project for our designated development duration. Our potential approach to switch between regular User profile to Host profile via a CTA. Upon account switch, the user will be prompted to provide more detailed information about themselves, the property and the workspace.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p>The following steps we took were to implemented  concept design methodologies and strategies to define the problem and design user-centered features as solutions. Moreover, to learn and understand the pain points our prospect user's encounter while navigating through content heavy and data-driven platforms to accomplish their desired goals. The following documentation is a collaborative effort divided equally between the team of 3 designers. As the Lead Designer, I was responsible for delegating tasks to designers based on weekly schedule.</p>

                    <p>Design team members participated in the early stages of defining the concept and as we progressed into more in-depth stages, specific tasks were assigned to designers were based on their interests, or area of expertise. I would review and conduct critique sessions, as well as assigning tasks per design team meeting, which were hold at least twice a week for more dynamic communication between members. The quality of deliverables, cohesiveness in cross platform Visual Assets and implementation of branding principles are some of my tasks.</p>

                        <p>The design team collaborated on conducting market research, analyzing the collected data and creating two fictional user personas that would communicate our prospect users goals, frustrations, etc. Alice Wu and Marina Moore represent two distinguished user demographics, which demonstrates the variety of our end-users.</p>
                        <p>We chose to use the personas we created as female professionals to demonstrate the diversity of users, regardless of their race or gender. The logic behind choosing two very contrasting colors, blue and red, also supports the same ethics. More information on branding and color theory can be found in the User Interface tab.</p>

                        <p>The flow of the web app begins from the home page, where the user can choose to search for listings before logging in or even signing up. The intention was to navigate the user to the search results quickly. Furthermore, this platform didn't require extensive onboarding process since the user can use the search bar to find listings. Therefore, the provided content on the landing part of the Home page eliminated the need for designing onboarding screens.</p>

                        <p>Collaborating on the UserFlow within the design team, we were able to focus on the user task flow for each feature individually and refine, finalize and combine each segment as we reviewed the results during weekly team meetings. The final UserFlow is the result of 5 iterations within 2 weeks of development, which allowed us to improve the flow while taking constraints set by the developers and the business requirements into effect.</p>

                        <p>Our platform created a massive inventory of amenity options, considering many aspects while conducting the list of amenity options suitable for efficient workspace. We chose to utilize Affinity Diagram to filter down and create categories for amenity options, and we were able to refine three main categories to classify the data with. Both designers and developers were the participants in refining the amenity categories.</p>
                        <p>Business Utilities, Facilities and Common Areas are the 3 main categories, which also helps the visual hierarchy when designing for the User Interface. We then utilized this classification to group the amenity filter options for each listing. We also planned to design customized icons for each amenity option to show them as descriptive and visually appealing to our end-users, helping them identify options much faster.</p>

                    <p>The listing cards will be populated in single columns on small screen sizes, and in 2 columns for large screen size.

                        <p>The chosen direction for the illustration and brainstorming ideas on approaching this asset was done entirely within the design team. However, drawing, polishing and executing each illustration assigned to each member was an individual activity.</p>
                        <p>The collection of illustrations required for the platform, such as the hero image, pop-ups and modals illustrations, etc., was divided between two designers. The third designer was responsible for the gif animations showcasing the features displayed on the home page.</p>
