                    <p>The design team designed and executed wireframes for the responsive web app and  the promotional WordPress website. The complexity of this step of the project was  to make the right design decisions when implimenting color on wireframes.</p>
                    <p>Initialliy, we chose to color code the types of alerts and notifications, requests and booking for users to recognize the catogeries. We also planned corresponding illustrations and iconography as a more descriptive yet visual approach.</p>

                    <p>Design team chose to start the branding process by designing the logo. The final result of 10 days of sketching is the displayed logo. The concept behind the logo is to demonstrate our emphasize on the ease of Communication within your residential environment, hence having the communication iconic symbol combined with the initial letter of Tenex, the letter "T". The overall shape represents an enclosed environment that is created from efficient communication.</p>
