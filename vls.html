                        <p>Virtual Learning Support, a place where you can find resources and connect with someone from the Learning Support Team to get help with academic and online learning. This website is a service supported by Langara College. The development team consisted of project Administrator and two WordPress developers. </p>
                        <p>My role eventually transformed into focusing mainly on user experience and user interface design of the website. My colleague took the responsibility of coding and Wordpress front-end development. Nonetheless, I assisted the project administrator in minor front-end coding during urgent occasions, such as in the absence of our Developer.</p>

                            <h3>Problem</h3>
                            <p>The majority of Virtual Learning Support users are students, who access the website via their desktop devices (based on analytics provided by the project Administrator). Initially, the structure of website had been created via WordPress templates (Twenty Ten), utilizing Elementor to customize the interface. Therefore, the installed plugins such as calendar, contact form, etc. gave us limited opportunities to manipulate and redesign the User Experience aspect.</p>

                            <h3>Solution</h3>
                            <p>Our solution to update and create an accessible, user-centered design was to create documentation of required updates, which we will go through in the following sections, and redesign the User Interface to create dynamic yet user friendly website. After first iteration of design updates, we planned to investigate more on the existing plugins and update sections based on the upated direction of the platform.</p>

                    <p>I created workpackages for both design and development schedule by separating Mobile and Ipad iterations as the first step, and continue working on desktop for the following week. The intention behind distinguishing the process in sprints suited the responsive design we anticipated for a variety of screen sizes. We would discuss design process during Monday team meetings and after approval from all stakeholders, I would start designing for desktop for the following week.</p>
                    <p>My collaboration with Virtual Learning Support started by prioritizing sections regarding development plan based on the context of each page (services). Some pages required updates on dataset from different departments, hence those services became the least priorty of development until updated. The process of planning out the development steps prompt me to start the task management of the project via Asana Software.</p>

                    <p>The displayed charts of sections and subsections demosntartes the content provided per each service. The remaining pages such as FAQS and Tips & Resources, had the lowest severity to be inclused in the development schedule since they were at an acceptable state (Visually).</p>

                    <p>We were able to conduct an accessibility test after 70% of the development plan was accomplished. We conducted the usability remotely with a visually impared student from Langara College.</p>
                    <p>The major change that had to be anticipated in the design aspect for the project aspect was to keep anchor tags hihlighted with underlines on hover, and implement more decriptive labels as button text.</p>

                        <p>As displayed on the screenshots below, the initial state of the website ws very cluttered and unorganized. We started the development by designing and developing the menu. I utilized a hamburger menu to minimize the menu space on mobile sizes. Also, Having a number of navigation menu items required a collabsoable menu. The menu in the updated version (displayed in the next section) is compatibale with both small and larger device sizes.</p>
                        <p>The format of services menu in the middle section of the screen was recommended to be kept by the project manager since the accessibility to core supporting pages for students is the service this platform provides. Having constraints on the instulled and oporating plugins, there was not much room for improvment </p>
