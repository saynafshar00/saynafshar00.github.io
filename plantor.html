                        <p>The project is in the agriculture industry. We will be solving the problem of users who are new to gardening not knowing what plants they can grow at home. We will be solving this problem by creating a mobile app to provide users with suggestions on plants they can grow at home based on location, season & light exposure.</p>

                        <p>Via our Android Native Application, users can get top 10 plant suggestions suitable to their inputted information about the environment, whether looking for plants to grow indoor or outdoor. These suggestions can be filtered upon users preference, to view pet-friendly/non-pet-friendly and edible/non-edible options.</p>

                            <p>The feature provides users suggestions on what plants users can grow at home based on the users’ location, season, and light exposure. This solves the problem of users who want to start gardening at home but do not know what plants they can grow.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Users will provide their location, light source, and the app will provide the top 10 suggestions on what the user can grow at home. This feature will be utilizing the magnetometer (to determine users’ light source orientation), geolocation (to determine the climate based on users’ location), and the date/time functionality (to determine the current season) of the mobile device.</p>

                            <p>The feature will be used to save user location’s environment information in the app. This makes it more convenient for users to keep track of the plants that they can grow and remember which seeds or starter plants to buy when they get to the plant shop. This will also reduce the number of times users need to input their environment information into the app to get plant suggestions in the future.</p>

                            <p>Users can save the environment information on the plant suggestion screen after inputting the environment information needed for the app to provide plant suggestions. The saved environment will be stored and displayed on the “Saved” page. Users can always rename or delete the saved environment. When users tap on the saved environment, they will be navigated to the plant suggestion screen and the app will display the suggested plants based on the saved environment’s information.</p>

                    <p>According to a Grand View Research lawn and gardening consumables market analysis report (https://bit.ly/3DjDNnG), the global lawn and gardening consumables market was valued at USD 19.50 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow to USD 25.94 billion by 2027. Among all the demographics, the residential segment accounts for the largest share of the market of more than 45% in 2019 and is expected to grow at the highest rate.</p>
                    <p> A common problem with people new to gardening is that they do not know what they can grow at home. That’s when our app can come in handy to solve the problem of the growing number of new residential gardeners. Our app will be recommending to the new residential gardeners what plants they can grow at home.

                    <p>The concept of the project, due to the limited timeline (10 weeks), only focus on the client-side, where the user inputs location and gets access to a variety of listings. The Host-side and how they can create a listing are set for the future roadmap. We anticipated allowing regular users to convert and upgrade their User profile to Host via a button. By providing more detailed information about themselves, property and workspace, they can start creating listings.</p>
                    <p>The following steps we took during the defining phase of the project to learn more about our prospect user's pain points, needs and how they can use navigation through our platform to accomplish their desired goal. The flowing documentation is a collaborative effort divided equally between the team of 3 designers. As the Lead Designer, I was responsible for guiding towards cohesiveness of the project, branding and meeting deadlines efficiently.
