We will be solving this problem by creating a mobile app to provide users with suggestions on plants they can grow at home based on location, season & light exposure.</p>

                        <p>Via our Android Native Application, users can get top 10 plant suggestions suitable to their inputted information about the environment, whether looking for plants to grow indoor or outdoor. These suggestions can be filtered upon users preference, to view pet-friendly/non-pet-friendly and edible/non-edible options.</p>

                            <p>Via this platform, we help users, whether a beginner or experienced, to get plant recommendations based on the mentioned factors. Therefore, users can grow suggested plants and receive weather hazard notification to maintain a safe environment for their plants to grow.</p>

                        <p>According to a Grand View Research lawn and gardening consumables market analysis report (https://bit.ly/3DjDNnG), the global lawn and gardening consumables market was valued at USD 19.50 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow to USD 25.94 billion by 2027. Among all the demographics, the residential segment accounts for the largest share of the market of more than 45% in 2019 and is expected to grow at the highest rate.</p><br>
                        <p> A common problem with people new to gardening is that they do not know what they can grow at home. That’s when our app can come in handy to solve the problem of the growing number of new residential gardeners. Our app will be recommending to the new residential gardeners what plants they can grow at home.

                    <p>We have 3 endpoints for data sets for the users, plants, and cities. User dataset will have basic user information, saved articles and saved environments for that user. Plants dataset will have all the plant information that our algorithm requires to filter through and suggest plants to users that they can grow. Cities dataset will have the cities information for the algorithm to apply filters for outdoor plant suggestions.</p>

                    <p>The concept of the project, due to the limited timeline (10 weeks), only focus on the client-side, where the user inputs location and gets access to a variety of listings. The Host-side and how they can create a listing are set for the future roadmap. We anticipated allowing regular users to convert and upgrade their User profile to Host via a button. By providing more detailed information about themselves, property and workspace, they can start creating listings.</p>
                    <p>The following steps we took during the defining phase of the project to learn more about our prospect user's pain points, needs and how they can use navigation through our platform to accomplish their desired goal. The flowing documentation is a collaborative effort divided equally between the team of 3 designers. As the Lead Designer, I was responsible for guiding towards cohesiveness of the project, branding and meeting deadlines efficiently. All the design team members participate in the early stages of defining the concept.</p>
